# ArchAI - Architecture as Code Platform

## Project Overview
This is a GitHub repository for "ArchAI" - a platform that combines AI (LLMs) with enterprise architecture frameworks (TOGAF, eTOM, TAM).

**Current Status:** Empty repository - only documentation exists (PRD.md and README.md)

## Project Vision (from PRD)
- **Goal:** Create Architecture as Code platform with AI agents
- **Features:** 
  - Generate TOGAF, eTOM, and TAM models automatically
  - Native connector for LeanIX, ArchiMate, and C4 models
  - AI agents for governance and real-time responses
  - Export Architecture as Code in YAML/JSON
  
## Technology Stack
Not yet defined - no code exists in the repository

## Project Structure
- `/PRD.md` - Product Requirements Document
- `/README.md` - Git workflow instructions (in Portuguese)

## Development Status
This repository was recently recreated and currently contains only documentation. No application code, dependencies, or configuration files have been added yet.

## Next Steps
The project needs to be built from scratch based on the requirements in PRD.md. This would include:
1. Choosing technology stack (Python/Node.js for backend, React/Vue for frontend)
2. Setting up LLM integration (OpenAI/Anthropic)
3. Building architecture model generators
4. Creating API connectors for LeanIX, ArchiMate, etc.
5. Implementing AI agents with RAG
